The Tyee is coming up on a big birthday. In 2018, we’ll be 15 years old. We always want to stay true to our roots as a fiercely independent news website that puts readers first. That’s why we’re asking our community to help us lock in a more sustainable future, and keep us around for another 15 years and beyond.	</big></p>
<p>
If we reach our target, contributions from Tyee Builders will become the biggest source of revenue for The Tyee, for the first time ever. Please join us in building a better media system, one that is driven first and foremost by the needs of readers.
