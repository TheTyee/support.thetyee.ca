<p><big>British Columbia has an election on right now. British Columbians need independent, fact-driven reporting from a source they can trust, now more than ever.</big></p>

Tyee reporters have been doing deep reporting on election-related issues for months, reviewing the governmentâ€™s record and digging deep on major infrastructure and energy projects in B.C. Topping up our election reporting fund now will help us pay experienced, tough-minded journalists to report on what political candidates are promising B.C. voters, and how those promises stand up to the facts.
